# AWS Site-to-Site VPN Private IP VPN - Terraform

This repository contains terraform code to deploy an AWS Site-to-Site VPN Private IP VPN over AWS Direct Connect. The following resources are created by default:

- Direct Connect gateway. If you want to test this code over an existing Direct Connect gateway, add its ID in the `dxgw_id` variable.
- AWS Transit Gateway, and one Transit Gateway Route Table where all the VPCs and the VPN will be associated and they will propagate their routes.
- Customer gateway, and **AWS Site-to-Site VPN Private IP VPN**.
- Two Amazon VPCs attached to the Transit Gateway (defined in the *locals.tf* file), with EC2 instances and SSM endpoints (decentralized) to test end-to-end connectivity once the VPN tunnels are configured.

In both examples, some information is asked in the *variables.tf* file in order to create the hybrid network:

- ASN numbers: AWS-side (for the Transit Gateway and the Direct Connect gateway), and customer-side (for the Customer gateway).
- Transit Gateway CIDR block - used for the private Outer IPs when creating the VPN.
- Allowed prefixes - AWS-side CIDR blocks. To add in the Direct Connect gateway (if created)
- Customer gateway IP - use the private IP of your device on premises.

**The resources deployed and the architectural pattern they follow is purely for demonstration/testing purposes**. Take it as an example on how to create all the necessary resources to build a Private IP VPN on top of a Direct Connect connection. The configuration of the VPN tunnels in the on-premises routers is done as an usual AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection (check the documentation in the *References* section).

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with an IAM user with the appropriate permissions
- Terraform installed

## Code Principles

- Writing DRY (Do No Repeat Yourself) code using a modular design pattern

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](../../images/aws_s2s_private_ip_vpn.png)

## Usage

- Clone the repository
- Edit the *variables.tf* file (in the root directory) to configure the AWS Region to use, the project identifier, and the number of Availability Zones to use. Edit the *locals.tf* (in the root directory) to configure the VPCs to create.
- To change the configuration about the Security Groups and VPC endpoints to create, edit the *locals.tf* file in the project root directory.
- Initialize Terraform using `terraform init`.
- Now you can deploy the rest of the infrastructure using `terraform apply`.
- To delete everything, use `terraform destroy`.

**Note** The default number of Availability Zones to use in the VPCs is 1. To follow best practices, each resource - EC2 instance, and VPC endpoints - will be created in each Availability Zone. **Keep this in mind** to avoid extra costs unless you are happy to deploy more resources and accept additional costs.
